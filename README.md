# COSTAs
TREND summer 23' COSTA's code

Created an intuitive GUI based on the mathematical model of spontaneous calcium(II) oscillations in astrocytes (Laventrovich, 2008). An additonal module to fit experiemntal data to the model is also being developed.

Lavrentovich, Maxim, and Sheryl Hemkin. “A mathematical model of spontaneous calcium(ii) oscillations in astrocytes.” Journal of Theoretical Biology, vol. 251, no. 4, 14 Feb. 2008, pp. 553–560, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.12.011. 

Code adapted from available Python code contributed by Dr T Manninen. Github user tommorse. 

HOW TO RUN COSTAs:

**note** ODE45 packet should be installed before running any code

1. Save ModelParameters.m and ModelSystem.m as different files in your MATLAB folder.
2. Save astrocyte_traces.mat and move to the same folder
3. Download SponAsMod.mlapp and run using MATLAB App Designer.
